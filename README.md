Put your words on the page using the SpeechRecognition API https://youtu.be/0mJC0A72Fnw

**This seems to only work properly in Chrome :cry: **

You will need to run `npm install` inside this directory to install browsersync, then run `npm start` to run the browsersync server.

The browser will usually prompt you to confirm use of the microphone. 

Once all that is running, speak and watch your words turn to text.
